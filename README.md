# Outbound Large Shipment Alert

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Large Shipment Alert (LSA) is Amazon ChimeBot scheduled to alert of shipments greater that a trigger appears on backlog.

Here's why:
* Large shipment are likely to cause CX impact
* Problem Solving tools (POPS) and PackApp are not designed to process such shipments with ease
* Shipment cycle time is greater than regular shpments

LSA is meant to run on AWS Lambda in order not to depend on personal virtual machines
